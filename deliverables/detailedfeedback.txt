'freeport' ~ kernel command to inform user of specific free network port

Nice work on this submission.

One thing to consider is, section 2.3 calls for a "Class diagram", but any
kind of diagram that shows how your project relates or is associated with
the kernel will work.  The 'diagram' you have doesn't show where your
project is located in the overall design of the O/S, nor does it show the
associations between your project and the kernel.  Is this going to be a
new kernel-level call that accesses a new common utility?  Or is it a new
kernel-level call that will access an existing common utility?  This needs
to be shown.

Nearly full credit earned, and this is gonna be very useful, I think!

Semester so far:
   homework01 100.00% * 10 points = 10.00 points
   homework02  95.00% * 10 points =  9.50 points
   delivery01 100.00% * 10 points = 10.00 points
   delivery02  95.00% * 10 points =  9.50 points
                        total:   39.00 out of 40 = 97.50% = A-plus

Keep up the good work!
