"freeport" ~ identify an available network port

This is a very useful idea!  Usually the use of "netstat" displays a HUGE
list of port information which must be sorted through to find the simple
information of an available port number.  The other alternative is to try
to guess at one that might be free and have to handle situations in which
the guess is incorrect.

I love the idea!  This is a very worthy project and well-described in your
preliminary document.  Be sure to research carefully about how to find and
present the information ~ if this is a kernel command, you won't be able
to use 'printf()' but instead must use 'kprintf()' for example.

Semester so far:
   homework01 100.00% * 10 points = 10.00 points
   delivery01 100.00% * 10 points = 10.00 points
                        total:   20.00 out of 20 = 100.00% = A-plus

Keep up the good work!
